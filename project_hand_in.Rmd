## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# 1. Input of data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gsutters/the-human-freedom-index?resource=download&select=hfi_cc_2021.csv

```{r}
data_2021 <- read.csv("data/hfi_cc_2021.csv")

names(data_2021)[1:10]
hist(data_2021$hf_score)

```
How did we obtain the data \# 2. Data Cleaning and Filtering organize
and tidy the data

```{r}
# select only personal freedom variables
data_pf <- data_2021[1:69]
```

```{r}
data_pf[1]
```

## 2.1. Remove not needed stuff

## 2.1. Identifying Missings

End up with a data in a standardized format across all data

# 3. Data Exploration

figure out what relevant questions there are in the data Inspect data
and its features what data types are there (numerical, categorical,
ordinal) - they require different treatments

## 3.1. Descriptive statistics

visualizations: identify patterns and trends in the data

# 4. Model data

Use regression and predictions for forecasting future values Or use
classification to identify groups

Reduce dumensionality of the data set - not all our values are
essentials to predicting the model

Select relevant features that contribute to the prediction of results or
apply shrinkage regressions

# 5. Interpret data

How do we present our analysis: basically answer the questions we set in
the beginning using our results - technical details are necessary but
make them accessible - tell a story
